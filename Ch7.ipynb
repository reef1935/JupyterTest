      "b'Words can\\'t describe how bad this movie is. I can\\'t explain it by writing only. You have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be. Not that I recommend you to do that. There are so many clich\\xc3\\xa9s, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To start with the technical first, there are a LOT of mistakes regarding the airplane. I won\\'t list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They didn\\'t even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early. Also, I was on the bad guys\\' side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. \"Executive Decision\" should without a doubt be you\\'re choice over this one, even the \"Turbulence\"-movies are better. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.'\n"
